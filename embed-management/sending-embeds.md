# Sending Embeds

There are 3 main ways to send embeds

You can send them to the current channel, send them to a different channel (with appropriate permissions for you and the bot) or you can DM it to yourself.



{% hint style="danger" %}
DMing to other users will not be added as this is considered spammy and will be a quick way to get the bot deactivated by Discord.
{% endhint %}
