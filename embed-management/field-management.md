# Field Management

These are all field management buttons

To create a field, use the green + button as seen above.

Enter the field name in "field name" and content in "value". Inline is just if you'd like to have your fields in a literal line

I'm going to add 2 more fields.

{% hint style="info" %}
When calculating the "index" of the fields, start at the first field but start at the number `0` instead of `1`

The first field is index 0, second 1, third 2, so on, so fourth.
{% endhint %}

Let's remove the useless field. Remember the `index` is `1`&#x20;

Now lets edit our mistake field

{% hint style="info" %}
Index is still important here too!
{% endhint %}

Set the index as `1`. I'm going to leave the name the same and fix my spelling error.

You _could_ also fix the first field, but I don't think it's necessary in this tutorial
