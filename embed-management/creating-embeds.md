# Creating Embeds

Start by going to the slash command menu, and selecting `/embed create`&#x20;

The Ephemeral value expects True or False. Setting this value to True will show this menu only to you, and False shows your menu to everyone, effectively turning it into a normal message.&#x20;

### Basic Embed Anatomy

#### Title and Description

Discord Embeds are made of different components. The only two that are required are the title and description, as shown below. The main content usually goes in your description.

All the essential components can be found in the Embed menu, as shown below.

After clicking the `Embed` button, you will get a prompt that looks like the image below.

#### Author

Another component is the author component. As its name suggests, this component is commonly used to show the username and profile picture of the embed's author but can be used for anything.

To set the values for the author component, click the `Author` button, which will show the menu as shown below. The 'author URL' turns the author component into the link that leads to that URL.
