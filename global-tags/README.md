# Global Tags

{% hint style="danger" %}
You will be permanently blacklisted from the bot if you create tags with malicious links, slurs, pornographic, or gore content. These rules are subject to change at any time with or without notice.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Users are given the ability to report commands after viewing them. From there the tag will be sent to the support server where appropriate action can be taken.
{% endhint %}

## What are tags?

"Tags" are essentially user created content that can be used multiple times to relay information. For example, a tag may be used to show resources on learning a specific topic. With this system, your tags are accessible by anyone!
