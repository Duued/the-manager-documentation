# Viewing Tags

### Getting a tag from a text command

To get a tag from a text command, simply use `*tag [name]`

{% hint style="info" %}
Tags with spaces in their name do **not** require quotes here.
{% endhint %}

### Reporting inappropriate tags

To report a tag, click the Red "Report this tag" button

This button will be disabled after one of the following conditions are met:

1. A user reports the tag
2. 5 minutes have past from the command

When someone clicks this button, the support server will automatically get a notification about the offending tag, allowing the appropriate action to be taken.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you accidently click the button, join the support server and open a ticket letting someone know. You won't be penalized for accidently doing it unless we think you do it "accidently" too much.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Users caught abusing this system will be blacklisted from using the bot. If we notice several reports coming from a specific guild, we may ban the bot from the guild along with users.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Inappropriate tags will be deleted and the owner will be banned from using the bot, with no appeal.
{% endhint %}
