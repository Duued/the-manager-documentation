### Reporting inappropriate tags

To report a tag, click the Red "Report this tag" button

The button disables after a tag is reported or 5 minutes have passed since the command was issued.&#x20;

When someone clicks this button, the support team will automatically get a notification about the offending tag, allowing the appropriate action to be taken.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Users caught abusing this system will be blacklisted from using the bot. If we notice several reports coming from a specific guild, we may ban the bot from the guild along with the users.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Inappropriate tags will be deleted and the owner will be banned from using the bot, with no appeal.
{% endhint %}
