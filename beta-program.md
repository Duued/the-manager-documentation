# Beta Program



{% hint style="warning" %}
The beta commands will be buggy and may not work as intended. By requesting beta access, you acknowledge and agree to report all bugs you may come across.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Once being approved for beta, it will be applied to your entire server. You will still have full access to normal commands, plus have the ability to use the beta commands!
{% endhint %}

To request beta, join [https://discord.gg/2yjqaAmjyq](https://discord.gg/2yjqaAmjyq) and open a ticket. The more beta testers we get, the quicker bugs can be found and features can be released to everyone!
